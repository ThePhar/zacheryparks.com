        <p>Hi there, my name is Zachery Parks and I'm a web developer. I've had many years of hobbyist experience developing various applications for friends and even a couple years working with engineers at my old workplace developing tools to enhance the productivity of myself and fellow co-workers. I'm currently looking to go full-time with my development skills so please, take the time to look in my Github repo and see all the projects I've worked on. If anything interests you or you have an idea for something we can work on together, please contact me and let me know.</p>
        <p>In addition to React and Node, I also have experience dealing with PHP+Laravel, Python, and some game development with Unity+C#.</p>
